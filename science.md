Science is the field of collective knowledge arrived at through the scientific method, which involves constructing a hypothesis and validating it by amassing evidence and running experiments. Science is never complete. It is an iterative process where new theories disprove the old. Natural sciences deal with understanding the observable world supplemented with tools provided by the formal sciences (like logic and mathematics). Applied sciences utilise information from both these fields to solve problems in the real world.
